Link to the notebook: https://github.com/amazirnim/Telco-Customer-Churn/blob/master/kaggle-churn.ipynb

Contains Result Analysis & Strategic Recommendations based on:

**Supervised machine learning**: 
	- Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN Classification, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis)

**Unsupervised machine learning**:
	- Clustering (K-Means Clustering, Silhouette Score, Elbow Method, Centroids)

---

**Model Evaluation**

**Metric Performance** (Accuracy, neg_log_loss, ROC AUC, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)

**Ensembles** (Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Voting Ensemble, Random Forest)

**XGBoost** (Tuning, Train and Test, Kfold, Stratified Kfold, XGBoost Decision Tree plotting, Feature Importance, Weigth-Cover-Gain)
